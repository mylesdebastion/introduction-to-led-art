Introduction to LED Art

Are you interested in interactive LED projects?
I will share tips, insights and behind-the-scenes look into my art practice using both live streaming and educational videos.

For my Patreon supporters, I will share source-code and project files from each session: https://www.patreon.com/mylesdebastion

So who am I? For starters, learn more about me and my work in this video feature by CNN's Great Big Story: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdwXPZ4vu-c
My work has appeared in Portland Art Museum, the Oregon Museum of Science & Industry, Portland Institute for Contemporary Art and on the Jimmy Kimmel Live! Show. I have built large format installations for music festivals and Grammy-award winning jazz artist Esperanza Spalding.
